Clean and modular Spring Boot application designed to provide a fully functional REST API for managing tasks in a simple and efficient way. It follows a well‑structured controller–service–repository architecture, ensuring clear separation of concerns and easy maintainability. The backend supports essential CRUD operations—creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks—while using Spring Data JPA for seamless database interaction with either H2 or MySQL. The project is built with Maven, runs on Java 17, and exposes intuitive JSON‑based endpoints that can be tested using Postman or cURL. Its lightweight design makes it ideal for beginners learning Spring Boot as well as developers looking for a solid foundation to extend with advanced features such as authentication, pagination, filtering, Docker deployment, or a React/Angular frontend. Overall, this project demonstrates clean coding practices, practical API design, and a scalable structure suitable for both learning and real‑world use.
